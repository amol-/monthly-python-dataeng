This release includes various new features, bug fixes, and performance improvements, as well as possible breaking changes.  \r\n\r\nThe pandas 3.0 release removed a functionality that was deprecated in previous releases. It is recommended to first upgrade to pandas 2.3 and to ensure your code is working without warnings, before upgrading to pandas 3.0.\r\n\r\nHighlights include:\r\n\r\n- [Dedicated string data type by default](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/whatsnew/v3.0.0.html#whatsnew-300-enhancements-string-dtype)\r\n- [Consistent copy/view behaviour with Copy-on-Write](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/whatsnew/v3.0.0.html#whatsnew-300-enhancements-copy_on_write) (CoW) (a.k.a. getting rid of the SettingWithCopyWarning)\r\n- [New default resolution for datetime-like data](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/whatsnew/v3.0.0.html#whatsnew-300-api-breaking-datetime-resolution-inference)\r\n- [Initial support for the new `pd.col` syntax](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/whatsnew/v3.0.0.html#whatsnew-300-enhancements-col)\r\n\r\nSee the [announcement blog post](https://pandas.pydata.org/community/blog/pandas-3.0.html) and the [detailed release notes](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/whatsnew/v3.0.0.html) for a list of all the changes.\r\n\r\nPandas 3.0.0 supports Python 3.11 and higher. \r\nThe release can be installed from PyPI\r\n\r\n    python -m pip install --upgrade pandas==3.0.*\r\n\r\nOr from conda-forge\r\n\r\n    conda install -c conda-forge pandas=3.0\r\n\r\nPlease report any issues with the release on the [pandas issue tracker](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/new/choose).\r\n\r\nThanks to all the contributors who made this release possible."

You used to be able to do implicit changes via: `my_collection.innerHTML = \"foo\"`. Feedback was this felt risky (folks thought they were mutating an element, not an element collection and they were getting strange results). Now you just: `my_collection.update_all(innerHTML=\"foo\")` which also makes it more obvious what's going on.\r\n    * Extensive rewrite of docstrings with examples. These form the basis of our new API docs.\r\n    * Added many more tests for the purpose of coverage and testing edge-cases."
