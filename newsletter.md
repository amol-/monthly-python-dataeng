## Fixes

* Code using the NumPy library was replaced with standard Python to enable the removal of NumPy from the dependencies list, by @tylerriccio33 in https://github.com/posit-dev/great-tables/pull/749
* An error when setting `groupname_col=` without `rowname_col=` in the `GT` constructor has been fixed by @juleswg23 in https://github.com/posit-dev/great-tables/pull/756
* Using `row_group_as_column = True` now structures row groups as a column in the stub (previously, this was a no-op), by @juleswg23 in https://github.com/posit-dev/great-tables/pull/754
* The `data_color()` method now takes the alpha value for the cell background color into account when choosing the foreground text color (fixes the internal `_ideal_fgnd_color()` util function), by @juleswg23 in https://github.com/posit-dev/great-tables/pull/747
* When enabling row striping, there is now better color contrast between the text and the underlying cell background, by @juleswg23 in https://github.com/posit-dev/great-tables/pull/745
* We now internally access column names consistently through `get_column_names()` instead of `.columns`, by @FBruzzesi in https://github.com/posit-dev/great-tables/pull/736
* Column values with the `pyarrow` `float64` type are now right-aligned to match the default behavior when using Pandas and Polars DFs, by @FBruzzesi in https://github.com/posit-dev/great-tables/pull/734
* We now avoid the double use of `clear` internally with Polars DFs, by @FBruzzesi in https://github.com/posit-dev/great-tables/pull/729

## Docs

* Various typos were corrected by @FBruzzesi in https://github.com/posit-dev/great-tables/pull/730
* We now include a Posit badge in the header of the project website, by @rich-iannone in https://github.com/posit-dev/great-tables/pull/777

## Chores

* Refactoring was done to better adhere to best practices and to improve code performance, by @FBruzzesi in https://github.com/posit-dev/great-tables/pull/731

## New Contributors
* @FBruzzesi made their first contribution in https://github.com/posit-dev/great-tables/pull/731

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/posit-dev/great-tables/compare/v0.18.0...v0.19.0
## Project: [posit-dev/py-shiny](https://shiny.posit.co/py/), 1 releases: ['shiny 1.5.0']
### Release: py-shiny [shiny 1.5.0](https://github.com/posit-dev/py-shiny/releases/tag/v1.5.0)
### New features

* Added AI-powered test generator for Shiny applications. Use `shiny add test` to automatically generate comprehensive Playwright tests for your apps using AI models from Anthropic or OpenAI. (#2041)

* `ui.sidebar()` is now interactively resizable. (#2020)

* `ui.sidebar()` gains a `fillable` argument to support vertical fill behavior in sidebars. (#2077)

* Added `ui.insert_nav_panel()`, `ui.remove_nav_panel()`, and `ui.update_nav_panel()` to support dynamic navigation. (#90)

* `navset_card_*()` now gains a `full_screen` option. (#1451)

* `ui.update_*()` functions now accept `ui.TagChild` (i.e., HTML) as input to the `label` and `icon` arguments. (#2020)

* The `.output_*()` methods of the `ClientData` class (e.g., `session.clientdata.output_height()`) can now be called without an `id` when called inside a `@render` function. (#1978)

* `playwright.controller.InputActionButton` gains a `expect_icon()` method. As a result, the already existing `expect_label()` no longer includes the icon. (#2020)

### Breaking changes

* The `ui.Chat` and `ui.MarkdownStream` components are now imported from the new `shinychat` library. Future versions of `shinychat` will likely deprecate and remove some features from `Chat`. If you still want to use those features with the latest Shiny, we suggest pinning `shinychat` to it's initial release (v0.1.0). (#2051)

* `express.ui.insert_accordion_panel()`'s function signature has changed to be more ergonomic. Now you can pass the `panel_title` and `panel_contents` directly instead of `ui.hold()`ing the `ui.accordion_panel()` context manager. (#2042)

### Improvements

* Improved the styling and readability of markdown tables rendered by `ui.Chat()` and `ui.MarkdownStream()`. (#1973)

* `input_date()`, `input_date_range()`, `update_date()`, and `update_date_range()` now support `""` for values, mins, and maxes. In this case, no date will be specified on the client. (#1713) (#1689)

* Restricted the allowable types of the `choices` parameter of `input_select()`, `input_selectize()`, `update_select()`, and `update_selectize()` to actual set of allowable types (previously, the type was suggesting HTML-like values were supported). (#2048)

* Added module support for `session.clientdata` methods. This allows you to access client data values in Shiny modules without needing to namespace the keys explicitly. (#1978)

* Added `timeout_secs` parameter to `create_app_fixture` to allow testing apps with longer startup times. (#2033)

* Add support for selecting menu items in `Navset` controllers to improve dropdown navigation test coverage. (#2066)

* Python 3.13 is now offically supported and tested. (#1711)

### Bug fixes

* Fixed issue where apps run in Workbench were unexpectedly crashing. Apps running in Workbench will now have `ws_per_message_deflate=False` enforced. (#2005)

* `include_js()` and `include_css()` now work as expected in multi-user settings and also when multiple files from the same directory are included. (#2061, #2069)

* Fixed numerous issues related to programmatically updating selectize options. (#2053)
   * `update_selectize(options=...)` no longer gets ignored when `server=False` (the default).
   * `update_selectize(options=...)` now works as expected in a module.

* Fixed an issue with `update_selectize(server=True)` not properly displaying labels with HTML reserved characters like "&" (#1330)

* Fixed an issue with `ui.Chat()` sometimes wanting to scroll a parent element. (#1996)

* Fix several issues with bookmarking error reporting and documentation. (#2076, #1984, #1983)

* `input_date()` and `input_date_range()` once again use the client's (not the server) current date as the default `value`. (#2060)

* Fixed false positive warning in `layout_columns()` about number of widths vs elements. (#1704)

* Fixed `set()` method of the `InputSelectize` test controller so it clears existing selections before applying new values. (#2024)

### Deprecations

* `ui.update_navs()` is deprecated in favor of `ui.update_navset()`. (#2047)

* `ui.panel_well()` is deprecated in favor of `ui.card()`. (#2038)

* `selectize`, `remove_button`, and `options` parameters of `ui.input_select()` have been deprecated; use `ui.input_selectize()` instead. (Thanks, @ErdaradunGaztea!) (#1947)
